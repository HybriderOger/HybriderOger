- 👋 Hi, I’m @HybriderOger
- 👀 I’m interested in swamp maintenance, roar programming, and the fine art of mud pie making.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced ogre algebra (it's like regular algebra, but with more growling) and swamp creature communication protocols.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building the ultimate ogre-friendly coding environment and creating interactive swamp simulations.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a pigeon to the darkest part of the forest.
- 😄 Pronouns: og/er
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a code using only my sense of smell. Turns out, bad code stinks just as much as onions!
